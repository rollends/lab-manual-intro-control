# Introduction to Control Lab
This repository houses the lab manual constructed for **ECE 380** and **SE 380**, the introductory control course, during the online (remote) terms.
This repository contains the Lab Manual documentation.
It is built using `XeLaTeX` with TeXLive 2020.
It may not build on TeXLive 2021 due to various packages that I use breaking.
To perform the build on Linux or Mac, just run `make`.
The `Makefile` will create a temporary directory where the build is performed and then copy the result out if successful.

## Key Information
We are using `MATLAB R2019b` for this lab.
You should have access to this software through the University's plan or by remote desktop to `engterm` as well as are able to install it locally on your own personal machine.
If you are installing `MATLAB R2019b` on your own machine, make sure to install the following toolboxes as well:

 - Simulink
 - Control Systems Toolbox
 - Simulink Control Design
 - DSP (Digital Signal Processing) System Toolbox
 - Signal Processing Toolbox
 - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
 - Symbolic Math Toolbox

## Information for Instructors
Lab template files are held privately by myself at UW.
If you would like access, please contact me directly.
