# ECE 380 - Spring 2020 Lab
Welcome to **ECE 380, Introduction to Feedback Control**. My name is
**Rollen D'Souza**, and I am your Lab Instructor! Due to the very
interesting circumstances we are in, I have the pleasure of
delivering to you an _online_ lab that helps develop your
understanding of feedback control.

## A Little bit about the Course
We will be using `MATLAB R2020a` for this course. You should
have access to this software through the University's plan
or by remote desktop to `engterm` as well as are able to install it
locally on your own personal machine.

If you are installing `MATLAB R2020a` on your own machine, make
sure to install the following toolboxes as well:

 - Simulink
 - Control Systems Toolbox
 - Simulink Control Design
 - DSP (Digital Signal Processing) System Toolbox
 - Signal Processing Toolbox
 - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
 - Symbolic Math Toolbox

## A Little bit about Your Lab Instructor
Class of 2016 UW Soft Eng. Ditched programming temporarily to satisfy
my passion for math; now a Doctoral Candidate in ECE under
Prof. Christopher Nielsen studying an application of differential
geometry to nonlinear control design. Also a private pilot that
occassionally goes flying in a Cessna.
