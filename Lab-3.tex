\chapter{Bringing it Together: Lateral Motion Control}\label{Lab:3}
Imagine you are a young, aspiring, junior engineer at MoonX, a
private company in an alternate Universe, manufucturing a mining probe for the
Moon.\footnote{This society isn't particularly concerned about environmental
impacts. They have the technology to hop, skip and jump to another satellite
or planet.} Because of your junior status, they have only asked you to design
a simple controller that ensures the lunar module lands at the correct
location. The controller you design controls the level of horizontal thrust
to achieve a desired position relative to some point on the surface.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
  \item{
    \textbf{Use} the skills you learned in Labs~\ref{Lab:1} and~\ref{Lab:2}
    to identify parameters of an opaque, black box system.
  }
  \item{
    \textbf{Explore} and \textbf{report} on a variety of control strategies
    to stabilize the system and achieve objectives.
  }
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experimental Procedure}
This entire lab will be done using the ``\texttt{Lab\_3.slx}'' Simulink model.
In there you will find a number of blocks already placed for you in an open
loop configuration:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{a zero signal,}
  \item{a summing junction,}
  \item{an gain block,}
  \item{the ``Lunar Module Dynamics'' block, which represent the plant, and}
  \item{a terminator.}
\end{itemize}
