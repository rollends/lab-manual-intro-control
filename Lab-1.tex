\chapter{System Identification Fundamentals}\label{Lab:1}
Low-pass filters are ubiquitous. They can be found in the hardware of
audio processing chips, or the software of image editing tools. As you may
recall from a course on Signals and Systems theory\footnote{If you haven't
taken a course in Signals and Systems, speak to your Lab Instructor on
knowledge you may be lacking.}, a low-pass filter
is a system that, generally speaking, rejects high-frequency signals while
``passing through'' low-frequency signals. In this lab you will be asked
to analyze a low-pass filter block and determine its parameters via a time
domain approach. This is not meant to be a difficult lab and is instead
designed to give you a sense of the lab format. However, it will put to the
test your knowledge of signals and systems. If you have forgotten your
Laplace transforms, this is a good time to remind yourself of them!

In the real world, our models are rarely perfect. The techniques
you learn here generalize nonetheless. Whenever you confront a novel system,
devise a generic model that you think characterizes its behaviour and then
come up with experiments that expose its characteristics; this gives you
estimates of the generic model's parameters that best fit the actual system.
We will encounter such a situation in a future lab.

\section{Objectives}
The primary objectives of this lab are to
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
  \item{
    \textbf{Install} MATLAB, Simulink and required toolboxes.
    Alternatively, \textbf{connect remotely} to
    \url{engterm.uwaterloo.ca} or any other lab computer of your choice
    that has MATLAB.
  }
  \item{
    Understand how to \textbf{open} and \textbf{modify}
    a Simulink diagram and how to run a simulation.
  }
  \item{
    Understand how to \textbf{log} signals for future inspection.
  }
  \item{
    Understand how to \textbf{plot} figures and capture them.
  }
  \item{
    Understand the theory behind first-order low-pass systems.
  }
  \item{
    Understand how to \textbf{identify} a first-order low-pass system.
  }
\end{enumerate}
This is not a particularly long lab, but you may have trouble as it is
very likely your first encounter with Simulink. As a result, I suggest you
give you and your partner time to work through the lab and the problems.
I also recommend you spend some time by yourself exploring Simulink so as to
reduce the amount of time you spend on future labs.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
This entire lab will be done using the ``\texttt{Lab\_1.slx}'' Simulink model.
First extract the ``\texttt{Lab\_1\_Data.zip}'' file available from Learn.
Inside there you will find zip files created for each individual group. Extract
the zip file associated to your group, and there you will find the relevant
``\texttt{Lab\_1.slx}'' file. The R2018 version may be found in a nested
directory.

In the Simulink model you will
find a number of blocks already placed for you in an open loop configuration:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{a signal generator,}
  \item{a summing junction,}
  \item{an adjustable gain block,}
  \item{a ``plant'', the system we are going to analyze, and}
  \item{a terminator.}
\end{itemize}
%
The plant --- labelled \(P(s)\) in the diagram --- can be assumed to be a
transfer function taking the form
\[
  P(s) = \frac{b T}{s + a T} \quad ,
\]
where \(a, b > 0\) and \(T \in \{10, 100\}.\) Your goal is to use the
techniques described in the following subsections to estimate the parameters
\(a,\) \(b\) and \(T\) for your plant. This process is known as
\textbf{system identification} and it is a critical precursor to control
design. How can we design a controller if we don't even know the parameters
of the system we wish to control?

\subsection{Acquiring the Bandwidth in Time-Domain}
The goal of this portion of the lab is to acquire the bandwidth of the
given linear system. What is the bandwidth? To understand and acquire it,
we must first know what the DC gain of a system is.
%
\begin{definition}[label={def:lab1:dcgain}]{DC Gain}
  Let \(G(s)\) be a \emph{stable} transfer function
  that maps an input signal \(U(s)\) to an
  output \(Y(s).\) The \textbf{DC gain} of \(G(s)\) is \(G(0)\) and,
  if \(u(t) = A \mathbf{1}(t)\) for \(A \in \Real,\) it satisfies the relation
  \[
    \lim_{t\to \infty} y(t) = A G(0).
  \]
\end{definition}
%
Observe that the DC gain \(G(0)\) is called precisely that because when we
apply a square (DC-like; step) signal change, the system's output converges
to the amplitude of the input times \(G(0).\)
%
Instead of computing the DC gain by evaluating the system's response to a step
input, we take a different approach.
%
\begin{procedure}[label={proc:lab1:p1}]
  You will acquire the DC gain of the plant \(P(s)\). Follow these steps:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item{
      \textbf{Open} the signal generator block, \textbf{set} the type of signal
      to be a sinusoidal wave, and set the
      \textbf{amplitude} to be \(1\) and the \textbf{frequency}
      to be \(\SI{0.5}{Hz}.\) This signal is so low frequency that it
      emulates a constant signal.
    }
    \item{
      \textbf{Run} the script \texttt{generate\_lab\_1\_plot.m} and inspect
      Figure 1, which depicts the input and output signal.
    }
    \item{
      \textbf{Measure the peak to peak amplitudes} of the input and output signals respectively when the system is in steady-state.
    }
    \item{
      \textbf{Estimate} the DC gain by dividing the output amplitude
      by the input amplitude. \emph{Remember, we chose the input amplitude
      to be \(1\)!}
    }
  \end{enumerate}
\end{procedure}
%
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{images/Lab_1_LowFrequency.eps}
  \caption[Low Frequency Response of a Low-Pass Plant]{The low-frequency response to my low-pass plant \(P(s).\) The gain
  at this low frequency is \(0.8395.\) Can you see why? What is the DC
  gain approximately?}
  \label{fig:lab1:lowfreq}
\end{figure}
%
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{images/Lab_1_Bandwidth.eps}
  \caption[Time-Domain Response of a First-Order System at the Bandwidth Frequency]{The response to my \(P(s)\) at the bandwidth frequency.
  Can you see why this is the bandwidth frequency for my plant?}
  \label{fig:lab1:bandwidth}
\end{figure}
%
\begin{deliverable}[label={lab1:d1}]
  \textbf{Record} your estimated DC gain and \textbf{capture} the generated
  figure with the cursors you used to measure the amplitudes.
  Your figure should like Figure~\ref{fig:lab1:lowfreq}.
\end{deliverable}
%
For low-pass systems, as we increase the frequency of the input, we will
observe, the output amplitude \emph{decreases}. The bandwidth frequency
is the frequency that marks the point where we distinguish between the
``low'' frequency inputs a low-pass system sustains and the ``high'' frequency
inputs a low-pass system rejects.
%
\begin{definition}[]{Bandwidth}
  Let \(G(s)\) be a proper transfer function
  that maps an input signal \(U(s)\) to an output \(Y(s).\)
%
  Say the input is a sinusoid of the form \(A \cos(\omega t)\) with amplitude
  \(A.\) In steady-state, the amplitude of \(y(t)\) converges to a constant
  \(B.\) The \textbf{gain at frequency \(\omega\)} is
  \(\left\|G(j\omega)\right\| = \frac{B}{A}.\)
%
  The \textbf{bandwidth (frequency)} of \(G(s)\) is the \emph{smallest}
  frequency \(\omega\) which satisfies
  \[
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\left\|G(j\omega)\right\|}{\left\|G(0)\right\|}.
  \]
\end{definition}
%
What is the definition above trying to characterize? The
gain is the multiplier between the input amplitude and output amplitude. For
a low-pass system, this gain decreases as a function of input frequency. The
bandwidth frequency is the frequency where this gain has fallen, in comparison
to the DC gain, by factor of \(\sqrt{2}.\) This is further demonstrated
by the difference in response we observe between Figure~\ref{fig:lab1:lowfreq}
and Figure~\ref{fig:lab1:bandwidth}. Note how much smaller the output signal
is in the response with higher frequencies in comparison to the response
with lower frequencies.
%
\begin{procedure}[label={proc:lab1:p2}]
  You will acquire the bandwidth frequency of the plant \(P(s)\).
  Follow these steps:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item{
      \textbf{Predict} the amplitude of the steady-state output at the
      bandwidth frequency. As an example, if your DC gain is \(0.8395\) then
      the ratio between the input signal amplitude and the output signal
      at the bandwidth frequency is
      \[
        \frac{0.8395}{\sqrt{2}}.
      \]
      If my input signal has amplitude \(1,\) then I should look for
      an output signal amplitude with the above value.
    }
    \item{
      \label{lab1:p2:2}
      \textbf{Open} the signal generator block, \textbf{set} the type of signal
      to be a sinusoidal wave, and set the
      \textbf{amplitude} to be \(1\) and
      the \textbf{frequency} to be \(\SI{0.5}{Hz}.\)
    }
    \item{
      \textbf{Run} the script \texttt{generate\_lab\_1\_plot.m} and inspect
      Figure 1, which depicts the input and output signal.
    }
    \item{
      \label{lab1:p2:4}
      \textbf{Measure the amplitudes} of the output signal
      when the system is in steady-state.
    }
    \item{
      If the amplitude isn't what you want, repeat Steps~\ref{lab1:p2:2} through~\ref{lab1:p2:4} with a different frequency. Increase or decrease
      by orders of magnitude to speed up the process!
    }
    \item{
      If the amplitude is what you predicted, \textbf{record} the frequency
      of the input you used to achieve the result.
    }
  \end{enumerate}
\end{procedure}
%
\begin{deliverable}[label={lab1:d2}]
  At the bandwidth frequency,
  \textbf{capture a figure} of the input and output signal. It should look
  like Figure~\ref{fig:lab1:bandwidth}. Pay close attention to the time
  axis; it has been scaled to make the signal easy to measure and to visualize.
\end{deliverable}
%
Having acquired the bandwidth for the open loop system, we now investigate
the closed loop system.

\subsection{Acquiring the Settling Time and Time Constant}
In this section of Lab 1 we take a different approach to estimating the plant
parameters. Instead of feeding in a sinusoid of low and high frequency, we
acquire what is known as the \textbf{step response}. The step response of
a plant \(P(s)\) is the output \(Y(s) = P(s) U(s)\) when \(U(s)\) is the unit
step function, i.e. \(U(s) = \frac{1}{s}.\) In practice, we often feed
square waves.
%
There are two characteristic values we care about for a first-order step
response. The \(2\%\)-settling time and the time constant.
\begin{definition}[]{The \(2\%\)-Settling Time}
  For a plant \(P(s)\) and step input \(U(s) = \frac{1}{s},\)
  the \textbf{\(2\%\)-Settling Time} is the time \(T\) it takes for
  the output \(y(t)\) to reach within \(2\%\) of its final value and stay
  within that \(2\%\) margin for all future time \(t > T.\)
\end{definition}
%
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \subfloat[Complete step response.\label{fig:lab1:settling-time:a}]{%
    \includegraphics{images/Lab_1_SettlingTime_1.eps}%
  }\hfill
  \subfloat[Zoomed-in view on the settling behaviour of signal.%

    \includegraphics{images/Lab_1_SettlingTime_2.eps}%

  \caption[Step Response for a Linear Plant depicting Settling Time Measurements]{
    The step response of some unknown plant with the \(2\%\)-settling time
    annotated in part (b). Observe how the the signal stays in
    the \(2\%\) region, demarcated by the broken lines,
    after the settling time of \(\SI{391.4}{ms}\) is attained.
  }
  \label{fig:lab1:settling-time}
\end{figure}
%
The settling time is a measure of long-term behaviour.
The notion is best depicted by Figure
\ref{fig:lab1:settling-time}.
In Figure~\ref{fig:lab1:settling-time:a} the ``net'' final value is
measured \emph{from the base to the top} of the signal. Then \(2\%\) of the
settling value is computed to define a cut-off point above and below the final
value, depicted as the broken lines in Figure
\ref{fig:lab1:settling-time:b}. Notice how the signal \emph{stays} in the
settling region after the settling time.
The next characteristic of the step response worthy of measurement is the
time constant. First let us define the standard first order form for a first
order transfer function.
%
\begin{definition}[]{Standard First-Order Form}
  The standard first order form for a strictly proper, first-order transfer
  function \(P(s)\) is
  \[
    P(s) = \frac{K}{\tau s + 1},
  \]
  where \(\tau, K \in \Real.\) The number \(\tau\) is called the \textbf{time
  constant}.
\end{definition}
%
It can be verified that the number \(K\) in the standard first order form
is simply the DC gain. The time constant can be estimated experimentally
in an easy way.
%
\begin{definition}[]{The Time Constant}
  For a first order plant \(P(s)\) and step input \(U(s) = \frac{1}{s},\)
  the time constant is the time \(\tau > 0\) it takes for
  the output \(y(t)\) to reach \(1-e^{-1} \approx 63\%\) of its final value.
\end{definition}
%
The time constant is a measure of transient, short-term behaviour. Note that,
unlike the settling time, the time constant only has meaning for a
first-order system. You will derive the relationship as one of your
deliverables.
%
\begin{procedure}[label={proc:lab1:p4}]
  In this procedure you will acquire the settling time and time constant
  of your plant \(P(s).\) First, \textbf{ensure} your plant is in open-loop
  configuration.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item{
      \textbf{Open} the signal generator block and \textbf{set} the type
      to be a square wave. Also, \textbf{set} the frequency to a low value,
      such as \(\SI{0.5}{Hz}.\) You will want to see atleast one step in
      the simulation but not too many more than that.
    }
    \item{
      \textbf{Run} the script \texttt{generate\_lab\_1\_plot.m} and inspect
      Figure 1, which depicts the input and output signal.
    }
    \item{
      Using cursors, \textbf{measure} the ``net'' final value by measuring from
      \emph{the base value of the signal to the final value}.
    }
    \item{
      Using the above measurement, \textbf{calculate} the \(63\%\) point
      where the time constant is found and \textbf{calculate} the \(2\%\)
      margins where the settling time is found.
    }
    \item{
      Using cursors, \textbf{measure} the time constant and settling times.
    }
  \end{enumerate}
\end{procedure}
%
\begin{deliverable}[label={lab1:d4}]
  \textbf{Capture the figure} you used to measure the settling time and
  time constant in Procedure~\ref{proc:lab1:p4}. \textbf{Show} your cursors.
\end{deliverable}
%
\begin{procedure}[label={proc:lab1:p5}]
  Repeat Procedure~\ref{proc:lab1:p4} for the closed-loop system described in
  Procedure~\ref{proc:lab1:p3}.
\end{procedure}
%
\begin{deliverable}[label={lab1:d5}]
  \textbf{Capture the figure} you used to measure the settling time and
  time constant in Procedure~\ref{proc:lab1:p5}. \textbf{Show} your cursors.
\end{deliverable}
%

\subsection{On Saturation or Clipping}
In practice, unlike in simulation, the signals we can apply to a system are
limited. This may be an inherent limitation, e.g.
power supply limitations, or a self-imposed safety limitation, e.g.
the angular velocity of an autonomous vehicle. Understanding where these hard
constraints appear in your control system is important, as usually these
constraints have \emph{nonlinear} effects! Ideally, we want to remain in
the region which has linear behaviour.

The only type of constraint you will encounter in these labs is the saturator
constraint. A \textbf{saturator}, or \textbf{clipper} as it is known in
electronics, limits a signal's maximum and minimum value to some preset
constant. In this section, you will attempt to find this limit.
%
\begin{procedure}[label={proc:lab1:p6}]
  \textbf{Put} your system in open-loop. \textbf{Set} the signal generator to
  generate a sinusoid with amplitude \(1\) at a low frequency.
  \textbf{Set} the gain \(K_p\) to \(1\) and \textbf{simulate}.
  \textbf{Increase} the gain \(K_p\) and \textbf{simulate} until you can
  observe the effects of saturation.
\end{procedure}
%
\begin{deliverable}[label={lab1:d6}]
  \textbf{Capture} the figure depicting the effects of saturation.
  \textbf{Record} the value of \(K_p\) where you had clipping occur.
\end{deliverable}
